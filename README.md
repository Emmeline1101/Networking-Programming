This is for the project/exercise done in the Networking-Programming course.  

A resilient, multi-threaded UDP-based file server is built, aiming to securely and efficiently transmit text files to clients upon request. Advanced synchronization mechanisms are implemented to ensure high concurrency and data integrity, alongside custom protocols for reliable file delivery over UDP's inherently unreliable transport layer
